and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Upcoming

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-22

### Changed

* Refactored interaction `container` modeling to a typed enum in `SlackModels.Container` - #60

### Fixed

* Fixed `block_actions` decoding for message-container payloads by allowing payloads without `view` - #60

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed

* Fixed schema mapping mismatch for user-shaped `profile` fields (issue [#42](https://github.com/ainame/swift-slack-client/issues/42)).
  * `User.profile`, `Member.profile`, `InvitingUser.profile`, and `TingUser.profile` now map to `UserProfile` instead of `Profile`.
  * Expanded `UserProfile` with missing properties from Slack user profile payloads (status metadata, normalized names, profile fields, additional image sizes, and app/bot metadata).
  * `TeamProfileGetResponse.profile` now maps to `TeamProfile` to reflect `team.profile.get` payload shape (`fields` / `sections`) instead of image-only `Profile`.
  * Updated generation pipeline to apply context-aware profile remapping while keeping `UserProfile` and `TeamProfile` as manually maintained models.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-08-17

### Added

* Minimum DocC documentation support https://ainame.github.io/swift-slack-client/documentation
* Schema update https://github.com/ainame/swift-slack-client/pull/33

### Fixed

* Schema update automation issue was resolved https://github.com/ainame/swift-slack-client/commit/44966ba5be88fe6df115d42f229bd04e9153f472
   * SwiftFormat got bug fixes around trailing commas and that helps us get consistently formatted code in schema updates


## [0.1.2] - 2025-06-28

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Item.ts Property**: Added optional `ts` property to `Item` model for reaction event compatibility
  - Fixed DeepL translator demo app where `item.ts` was accessed but didn't exist
  - `Item` now has `public var ts: Swift.String?` to support both reaction events and other APIs
  - Maintains type safety by keeping `ts` optional since it's not present in all contexts

### ✨ Added
- **Form-Encoding Middleware**: Automatic JSON to form-urlencoded conversion for Slack API compatibility
  - `FormEncodingMiddleware` installed by default in `SlackClient`
  - Transparent handling of Slack's POST + `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` requirement
  - Nested objects automatically serialized as JSON strings in form data
- **swift-dotenv Integration**: Environment variable management for DeepL translator demo
  - Added swift-dotenv dependency for cleaner configuration management
  - Removed ProcessInfo fallbacks in favor of explicit environment variable loading

### 🔧 Enhanced
- **Code Generation Pipeline**: Improved schema generation with `ItemTsOptionalAdder` visitor
  - Automatically adds optional `ts` property to Item schema during generation
  - Ensures consistency across WebAPI and Events API usage
- **Documentation**: Updated README with form-encoding workaround explanation
  - Honest documentation of temporary workaround nature
  - Technical notes section explaining design decisions

### 📋 Technical Notes
- Form-encoding middleware addresses swift-openapi-generator limitation with nested form data
- This is a workaround solution that may be updated in future versions
- All tests passing with new middleware and model changes

## [0.1.1] - 2025-06-28

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Slack API Compatibility**: Resolved `conversations.replies` "invalid_arguments" errors
  - Root cause: Slack APIs expect POST + `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, not `application/json`
  - swift-openapi-generator doesn't support nested containers with form-urlencoded
- **Modal View Protocol**: Fixed `callbackId` optionality mismatch between protocol and implementation
- **Test Suite**: Disabled WebSocket-dependent test that required mocking infrastructure

### ✨ Added
- **FormEncodingMiddleware**: Automatic request transformation for Slack API compatibility
  - Converts POST + JSON requests to POST + form-urlencoded automatically
  - Handles nested objects by serializing them as JSON strings in form fields
  - Installed by default in SlackClient for transparent operation

### 🔧 Enhanced
- **DeepL Translator Demo**: Improved error handling and API compatibility
  - Fixed reaction event handling with proper `conversations.replies` usage
  - Enhanced duplicate translation detection logic
  - Better fallback handling for non-threaded messages

## [0.1.0] - 2025-06-23

### 🚨 Breaking Changes
- **BREAKING**: Socket Mode interactive handlers now require explicit acknowledgment
  - Removed auto-acknowledgment for interactive handlers (global shortcuts, view submissions, slash commands, block actions, message shortcuts)
  - All interactive handlers must now call `try await context.ack()`
  - Event API handlers remain unchanged (no acknowledgment required)
  - **Migration**: Add `try await context.ack()` at the start of your interactive handlers

### ✨ Added
- **Custom Ack Functionality**: New `Ack` struct with multiple acknowledgment methods
  - `ack()` - Basic acknowledgment
  - `ack(responseAction: .update, view:)` - Update views to keep modals open during processing
  - `ack(errors: [String: String])` - Send validation errors back to forms
  - Support for response actions: `.update`, `.push`, `.clear`
- **StateValuesObject**: New form value extraction system for SlackBlockKit
  - Subscript access: `payload.view.state?["blockId", "actionId"]?.value`
  - Support for `selectedOption`, `selectedOptions`, `selectedDate`, etc.
  - Computed `state` property on `View` enum for easy access
  - Comprehensive unit tests for JSON decoding scenarios
- **DeepL Translator Demo App**: Complete real-world Slack bot implementation
  - Global shortcut and reaction-based translation features
  - Modal UI with form handling and loading states
  - Demonstrates proper custom Ack usage patterns
  - DeepL API integration with shared HTTPClient

### 🐛 Fixed
- Added missing `ts` field to `Item` struct for reaction events
